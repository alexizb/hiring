## About Enso
Enso (https://enso.org) is a no-code interactive ETL and data analysis tool. 
It lets you load, blend, analyze your data, and then automate the whole process, 
simply by connecting visual components together. 
At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds. We are backed by 
world-class investors, including Y Combinator.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## People We're Looking For
Thanks for your interest in working with Enso. We're currently looking to fill one role:

- **[Senior Rust Developer](people/senior-rust-developer.md)** to take
  charge of the design, development, and evolution of a new WebGL-based GUI for
  Enso. If you bring strong technical skills and a passion for user experience,
  this could be the role for you.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.

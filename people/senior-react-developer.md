## React Developer
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior react developer to take charge
of the design, development and evolution of a new responsive front-end for Enso,
a project said by Singularity University to have the potential to change the
lives of one-billion people. If you bring strong technical experience and
a passion for user experience, this role could be the one for you.

As a senior react developer, you'll spearhead the design of the new
user-interface for Enso Cloud, designing and building a front-end that can run
across multiple browsers. Your work will become an integral part
of Enso as you collaborate with a world-class team of skilled engineers,
community managers, and business developers (from Bloomberg, PayPal, and GitHub,
to name a few), and to make your mark on Enso's future.

#### What You're Looking For
As a senior react developer developer you'll be in charge of the creation of the
new front-end for the Enso Cloud. This will involve:

- Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design an interface that is
  both intuitive and fluid to work with.
- Implementing these solutions using modern front-end web-development
  technologies in a cross-platform manner to create an application that can run
  both in the browser and in electron.
- Managing and working around cross-browser compatibility issues.
- Contributing to the testing and integration of the user interface, from both
  functional and UI standpoints.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.
- Strong practical experience implementing large-scale, user-facing applications
  in Type Script.
- A strong understanding, based on practical experience, of modern front-end
  frameworks, with a focus on React.
- An understanding of cross-browser compatibility issues, and experience working
  around such problems.
- Familiarity with front-end build tools such as Webpack and Gulp.
- Experience with testing tools, both for integration and for front-end (e.g.
  Selenium).

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience with frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Next.js.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.

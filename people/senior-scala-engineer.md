for collaboration, this role could be for you.

As a senior scala engineer, you'll be leading the effort to design and

offering for Enso, hosting both the language and its IDE in the cloud.
This will involve:

- Working closely with the internal teams to design a secure and scalable SaaS
  architecture.
- Developing a SaaS solution based upon that design with robust tooling and
  reliability, as well as inbuilt support for collaboration.
- Contributing to the evolution of this vibrant open-source project by bringing
  a new component to its ecosystem and product offering.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- Solid understanding of Scala language elements of functional programming.
- Understanding of immutability.
- JVM basics, memory model, threads, principles of work knowledge.
- Data structures and basic algorithms knowledge.
- Systems design & networking (understanding basic principles) .

- Experience working with Git and Linux.
- Scala on backend: servers, web.
- Akka library: actors, streams, http.
- Git and source management flows, deployment.
- Cats, cats-effect libraries .
- Messaging systems, protocols and design patterns .

It would be a big bonus if you also had:

- Experience with Cloud computing architectures (AWS, Google Cloud).
- Experience with container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
- Experience working in close conjunction with multiple product teams to ensure
  that the solutions you provide meet their needs.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.

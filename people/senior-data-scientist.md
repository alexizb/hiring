## Senior Data Scientist
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior data scientist to help develop
data science libraries and pipelines for clients using Enso, a project said by
Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives of one-billion
people. If you bring strong analytical and technical skills, and have a passion
for data, this could be the role for you.

As a Senior Data Scientist at Enso, you'll be instrumental in the design and
development of custom solutions and pipelines to help our customers and clients
get the results that they need when working with Enso. You'll be able to
collaborate with a team of world-class engineers, community managers, and
business developers (from Bloomberg, PayPal, and GitHub, amongst others) to make
your mark on this project's future.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior data scientist at Enso, you'll be in charge of developing both
libraries and pipelines for customers and the wider community. This will
involve:

- Working closely with key stakeholders and customers to develop and tailor
  customised data-analysis toolkits and pipelines to fit their needs.
- Using your experience to inform design choices regarding Enso, especially
  around its support for data-analysis and machine-learning workflows.
- Working closely with internal teams to ensure that the product evolves to make
  such uses as simple and easy as possible.
- Contribute to the growth and success of a vibrant open-source project and its
  greater ecosystem.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a particular set of skills that we're looking for in this role:

- 5+ years practical experience working with data-science pipelines for
  performing automated analysis, predictive analytics, or machine learning.
- Practical experience with existing data-science toolkits such as Keras and
  Tensorflow.
- An interest in building new data-science tools and pipelines.
- Practical experience with at least one functional programming language,
  preferably Haskell. Please note that this does not count languages (such as
  Python), that enable limited forms of functional programming.
- An interest in working with clients and users to create solutions that fit
  their needs and enhance their work.

It would be a big bonus if you also had:

- Experience building customised data-science pipelines, tailored to particular
  tasks.
- Experience in the deployment of data-science solutions.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.

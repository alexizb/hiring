## Senior Interpreter Engineer
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior interpreter engineer to help 
build the next generation interpreter and runtime for Enso, a project said 
by Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives of
one-billion people. If you have strong technical skills and a passion for all
things interpreter, then this role could be the one for you.

As an interpreter engineer you'll work as part of the compiler team to design
and implement the new Enso interpreter and runtime, work that is at the very
core of the next phase of Enso's development. You'll have the opportunity to
collaborate with a world-class team of engineers, community managers, and
business developers (with experience at Bloomberg, GitHub, and PayPal, to name a
few), and make your indelible mark on the future of Enso.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior interpreter developer, you'll be working on the design and
development of the new Enso interpreter and runtime, to help support the
Language's evolution. This will involve:

- Working to design and implement the new Enso interpreter, including the
  optimiser, real-time introspection capabilities, and foreign-language
  interoperability.
- Practical work improving the performance of the interpreter and the code that
  it executes by diagnosing performance issues and implementing improvements.
- Practical work implementing front-end optimisations for Enso that improve the
  code that is executed by the interpreter.
- Working on and improving the introspection capabilities that allow external
  programs to inspect and modify the interpreter's state (including support for
  debugging).

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- Practical and rich experience writing code in either Scala or Java (3+ years),
  with working knowledge of _both_ languages.
- Experience building an interpreter for a programming language.
- A deep understanding of the JVM, its execution model, and garbage collection
  behaviours, born of practical experience.
- Experience using the JVM's profiling and debugging tools to solve problems on
  large-scale projects.
- Practical experience building large and complex software systems, as well as
  in their ongoing evolution and maintenance.

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience with GraalVM and the Truffle framework for programming language
  development.
- Experience using purely functional programming languages, such as Haskell, or
  purely-functional paradigms in multi-paradigm languages such as Scala.
- Experience employing type-level programming techniques in functional
  programming languages.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.

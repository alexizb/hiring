## Senior Devops Engineer
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior devops engineer to help
automate the processes and practices that underlie Enso, a project said by
Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives of one-billion
people. If you bring a wealth of experience with automation and a deep knowledge
of the internals of operating systems, this might be the job for you.

As a senior devops engineer at Enso, you'll be instrumental to the design and
automation of all the processes that support the creation, deployment, and
publication of the language and its IDE. You'll be able to do all of this in
collaboration with a team of world-class engineers, community managers, and
business developers (from PayPal, GitHub and Bloomberg, amongst others) to put
your touch on the future of Enso.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior devops engineer at Enso, you'll be in charge of developing the
tools, pipelines and processes that ensure that Enso is at its very best.
This will involve:

- Working closely with the compiler and IDE developers to create tailored
  solutions for the CI, and CD of Enso and Enso Studio.
- Create solutions for packaging Enso and Enso studio in a way that can be run
  across myriad computing systems.
- Create frameworks for creating packages in an operating-system independent
  manner.
- Contribute to the future of a rapidly growing open-source project, and its
  ecosystem.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a particular set of skills that we're looking for in this role:

- Knowledge of Haskell, with a particular focus on its build process (e.g. cabal
  the library, custom `Setup.hs` files).
- Practical knowledge of the ways that executables and library loading works on
  Linux, MacOS, and Windows, and the differences between them.
- Experience with how the above differences affects packaging, and the skills to
  debug related issues.
- Practical experience with designing and implementing automated pipelines for
  building, setting up environments for, testing, and packaging complex
  projects.
- Practical experience with some CI/CD system (we use Azure Pipelines).
- A focus on robustness, repeatability, and debugability, with an inclination to
  automation of tasks for integration with build- and development-tools.

Additionally, it would be a big bonus if you had:

- An understanding of the security concerns related to the above tasks.
- Experience with automated, high-level testing, particularly for GUI projects
  (e.g. Selenium).
- Experience with C++ Build Systems (e.g. CMake and MSBuild)
- Knowledge of computer networking and the operation of VPNs.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.

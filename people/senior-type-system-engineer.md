## Senior Type-System Engineer
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior type-system engineer to help
build the next generation interpreter and runtime for Enso, a project said by
Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives of one-billion
people. If you have strong technical skills and a passion for all things
compiler, then this role could be the one for you.

As a type-system engineer you'll work as part of the compiler team to design and
implement Enso's new type system, including its underlying theory, type-checker,
and inference engine. This wok is _intrinsic_ to Enso's evolution, and will
provide you with the opportunity to collaborate with a world-class team of
engineers, community managers, and business developers (with experience at
Bloomberg, GitHub, PayPal, to name a few), making your mark on Enso's future.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior type-system engineer, you'll be working on the design and
development of Enso's new type-system, in conjunction with the rest of the
compiler team, to help support the language's evolution. This will involve:

- Determining and formalising the theoretical underpinnings of the new type
  system in a way as to ensure its soundness.
- Both theoretical and practical treatments of the theory behind Enso's type
  system.
- Working with the broader compiler team to implement the type-checking and
  type-inference engines as part of the greater interpreter.
- Using the type-system's information to improve the interpreter's functionality
  and performance, as well as how it interacts with the users.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role.

- Practical and rich experience writing code in a functional programming
  language such as Haskell, including experience with type-level programming
  techniques (3+ years).
- A working knowledge of programming in Scala.
- Experience working with the theory behind powerful type systems, including
  row types, type-checking and type-inference algorithms, and dependently-typed
  systems.
- Practical experience building real-world type-systems, including facilities
  for both type-checking and inference.
- An awareness of the UX impacts of type-systems, and a willingness to minimise
  their often-intrusive nature.
- Practical experience in building large and complex software systems.

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience writing Java code, as it is used heavily in the interpreter and may
  also be involved in implementing the type-system.
- Experience in writing comprehensive regression tests for both type-inference
  and type-checking systems.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.

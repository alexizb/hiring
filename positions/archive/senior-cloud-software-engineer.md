## Senior Cloud/Kubernetes Engineer
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior cloud software engineer to
take charge of the design, development, and evolution of the new SaaS offering
for Enso, a project said by Singularity University to have the potential to
change the lives of one-billion people. If you bring strong technical skills and
have a passion for collaboration, this role could be for you.

As a senior cloud software engineer, you'll be leading the effort to design and
develop our new SaaS offering, providing a web-based version of Enso to our
clients. Your work will be integral to the next phase of Enso's development, as
we expand our offering beyond the open-source project. You'll be able to work
with a world-class team of skilled engineers, community managers, and business
developers (from Bloomberg, GitHub and PayPal to name a few), and put your
indelible stamp on Luna's future.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior cloud software engineer you'll be in charge of building the SaaS
offering for Enso, hosting both the language and its IDE in the cloud.
This will involve:

- Working closely with the internal teams to design a secure and scalable SaaS
  architecture.
- Developing a SaaS solution based upon that design with robust tooling and
  reliability, as well as inbuilt support for collaboration.
- Hosting the architecture on a cloud provider without becoming too dependent on
  any one given platform.
- Contributing to the evolution of this vibrant open-source project by bringing
  a new component to its ecosystem and product offering.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- 3+ years experience in designing secure, scalable, and collaboration-ready
  SaaS architectures.
- A strong commitment to security and scalability that permeates your approach
  to design.
- Experience with Kubernetes deployment and administration using EKS.
- Practical knowledge about AWS networking and storage architectures, and how
  they integrate with Kubernetes.
- Experience managing AWS resources using Terraform.
- Experience working in an SRE capacity on monitoring, incident handling and
  continuous service improvement.
- Experience building and delivering CI/CD pipelines to ensure service stability
  and reliability.
- Experience employing Devops practices such as the 'continuous everything' and
  'everything as code' styles of work.
- Experience working with Git, and preferably GitOps.

It would be a big bonus if you also had:

- Skills working with Azure and GCP to help expand beyond AWS in the future.
- Experience working in close conjunction with multiple product teams to ensure
  that the solutions you provide meet their needs.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.

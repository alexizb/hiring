## Senior Devops Engineer
[Enso](https://enso.org) is looking for a senior devops engineer to help
automate the processes and practices that underlie Enso, a project said by
Singularity University to have the potential to change the lives of one-billion
people. If you bring a wealth of experience with automation and a deep knowledge
of the internals of operating systems, this might be the job for you.

As a senior devops engineer at Enso, you'll be instrumental to the design and
automation of all the processes that support the creation, deployment, and
publication of the language and its IDE. You'll be able to do all of this in
collaboration with a team of world-class engineers, community managers, and
business developers (from PayPal, GitHub and Bloomberg, amongst others) to put
your touch on the future of Enso.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior cloud software engineer you'll be in charge of building the SaaS offering for Enso, hosting both the language and its IDE in the cloud. This will involve:

- Working closely with the internal teams to design a secure and scalable SaaS architecture.
- Developing a SaaS solution based upon that design with robust tooling and reliability, as well as inbuilt support for collaboration.
- Hosting the architecture on a cloud provider without becoming too dependent on any one given platform.
- Contributing to the evolution of this vibrant open-source project by bringing a new component to its ecosystem and product offering.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a particular set of skills that we're looking for in this role:

- 3+ years experience in designing secure, scalable, and collaboration-ready SaaS architectures.
- A strong commitment to security and scalability that permeates your approach to design.
- Experience with Kubernetes deployment and administration using EKS.
- Experience with Scala and Akka.
- Practical knowledge about AWS networking and storage architectures, and how they integrate with Kubernetes.
- Experience managing AWS resources using Terraform.
- Experience working in an SRE capacity on monitoring, incident handling and continuous service improvement.
- Experience building and delivering CI/CD pipelines to ensure service stability and reliability.
- Experience employing Devops practices such as the 'continuous everything' and 'everything as code' styles of work.
- Experience working with Git, and preferably GitOps.

Additionally, it would be a big bonus if you had:

- Skills working with Azure and GCP to help expand beyond AWS in the future.
- Experience working in close conjunction with multiple product teams to ensure that the solutions you provide meet their needs.

## About Enso
Enso is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Enso succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Enso that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Enso team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at [`jobs@enso.org`](mailto:jobs@enso.org), and tell us a
little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role!
You can also tell us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Enso, and where you imagine Enso being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.

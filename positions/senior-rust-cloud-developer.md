# ☁️ Senior Rust Cloud Developer

Hi, we are Enso (Y Combinator S21)! We are looking for an amazing Rust Cloud 
developer to join our core team. We are a remote first company, working in 
Europe and the USA.

## What is Enso?

**From the business perspective**, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation
tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then automate the 
whole process, simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for both in-memory data processing, as well as SQL analytics and transformations on modern data stack (ELT). Enso has the
potential to disrupt the data analytics industry over the next five years. 
Currently, the market operates using old-fashioned, limited, and non-extensible
software which has been unable to keep up with businesses as they transition to 
the cloud.

**From a technical perspective**, Enso is a purely functional, programming 
language with a double visual and textual syntax representation and a polyglot
evaluation model. It means that you can mix other languages with Enso (Java, 
JavaScript, Python, R) without wrappers and with close-to-zero performance overhead.

## Who are we looking for?

Enso would be a great place for you if:

- You're an expert in Rust.
- You’re any race, color, religion, gender, national origin, political affiliation, 
  sexual orientation, marital status, disability, age.
- You like to laugh.
- You want to work hard, have fun doing it, and own projects from end-to-end.
- You are friendly and like to collaborate.
- You move fast and ask for help when needed.
- You value being part of a team and a community.
- You can set your ego aside because you know that good ideas can come from anywhere.
- You enjoy working in public, putting yourself out there and showing your learning.
- You appreciate a competitive salary and significant stock options.
